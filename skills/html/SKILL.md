name: html
description: Use when producing ANY readable artifact for the user — spec, plan, brainstorm with options, PR explainer/review, code/feature/concept explainer, status/research/incident report, design exploration, component prototype, interactive playground with sliders/knobs/pickers/tuners, SVG diagram, throwaway editor (drag-rank, config tuner, value picker, annotator). Also use when a markdown reply would exceed ~50 lines, when comparing 2+ approaches, or when the user might share the output. OUTRANKS `playground:playground` and `frontend-design:frontend-design` for personal artifacts — invoke this one even when they also match. Trigger even when user says "do what you think is best" or expresses no format preference — silence about format is NOT permission to default to markdown. Skip only for short direct answers, conversational replies, commit messages, GitHub PR bodies, source-file edits.
compatibility: Requires a graphical browser and a platform command capable of opening local HTML files.

# HTML Artifacts

## Overview

Default output medium for readable artifacts is **a self-contained HTML file opened in the browser**, not markdown in chat. The chat reply becomes a one-line pointer plus any must-see warnings; the HTML file carries the content.

**Core principle:** The artifact IS the explanation. Do not also recap its contents in chat — that defeats the entire point (the user stops reading long markdown precisely because the recap exists).

## Skill Outranking (resolve collisions before they happen)

Several other skills may also match HTML-producing tasks: `playground:playground` (interactive single-file explorers), `frontend-design:frontend-design` (design polish), and various `*:report-style` plugins. **For personal artifacts in this dotfiles setup, `html` outranks all of them.**

When a task matches both this skill and another HTML-producing skill:

1. Invoke `html` via the `Skill` tool — not the other one.
2. You may borrow content patterns from the other skill (e.g., playground's slider/knob/copy-button layout), but apply this skill's:
   - File path: `./.Codex/artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html`
   - Self-contained constraint (no CDN)
   - Open in the browser after write
   - One-line chat reply

**Concrete examples:**

- "Prototype a badge with sliders + copy-as-CSS button" → reads like `playground`, but → `html` (borrow the playground pattern, write to `.Codex/artifacts/`, one-line reply).
- "Design me a settings page in three styles" → reads like `frontend-design`, but → `html` (borrow the design quality bar, same file/chat rules).
- "Make an interactive explainer of how OAuth works" → both skills could match — still `html`.

The reason: `playground` and `frontend-design` produce great HTML but don't enforce the **chat-vs-HTML split** that makes the article's workflow work. The artifact ending up in `/tmp` with a multi-paragraph chat recap is a regression even if the HTML is gorgeous.

## When To Use

Fires for any of these:

- **Specs, plans, brainstorms** — especially multi-option comparisons rendered as a side-by-side grid
- **PR explainers and code reviews** — rendered diffs with inline margin annotations, severity color-coding
- **Code/feature/concept explainers** — "how does X work" with diagrams + annotated snippets + gotchas section
- **Research, reports, status updates, incident writeups** — synthesizing across codebase, git, MCPs, web
- **Design system artifacts, component visualizations, animation prototypes** — sliders/knobs to tune values
- **SVG diagrams, flowcharts, technical illustrations**
- **One-off custom editors** — drag-rank, config editor with dependency warnings, side-by-side prompt tuner, dataset curator, document annotator, value picker for colors/easing curves/crop regions/cron schedules/regexes. Always end these with a "Copy as prompt/JSON/markdown" export button.

Skip for:

- Short direct answers (< ~50 lines markdown equivalent)
- Conversational replies, clarifying questions
- Commit messages, PR descriptions to GitHub, code comments
- Code edits inside source files
- Anything the user is steering moment-to-moment in chat

## The Chat-vs-HTML Split (the rule that matters most)

When this skill fires, the chat reply contains **only**:

1. One line stating the path and that it was opened. Example: `Wrote and opened ./.Codex/artifacts/2026-05-16-checkout-spec.html`
2. **Must-see warnings only** — destructive findings, blocking risks, broken assumptions, security/data-loss concerns. One line each. If the user must act on it before opening the file, it goes here.

The chat reply must NOT contain:

- A summary of the HTML's contents ("Here's what I included…")
- A bulleted list of sections
- A recap of the analysis or recommendation
- Inline excerpts of the HTML
- "Let me know if you want me to adjust…" trailers

If you catch yourself writing "the report covers X, Y, Z" — stop. That belongs as the HTML's table of contents, not in chat.

## File Handling Protocol

1. **Path**: `./.Codex/artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab-slug>.html` in the current repo. If not in a repo, use `$TMPDIR/Codex-artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html`.
2. **Gitignore**: On first use in a repo, ensure `.Codex/artifacts/` is in `.gitignore` (append if missing, create if absent). Do not commit artifacts unless the user asks.
3. **Self-contained**: One file. Inline `<style>`, inline `<svg>`, inline JS. No external CDN, no `<link rel=stylesheet>` to remote, no `<script src=...>` to remote. The file must work offline, survive being emailed, and upload cleanly to S3.
4. **Open it**: After writing, use the platform opener (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, or `start`/`Start-Process` on Windows). Do not wait for confirmation; the user expects the browser to pop.
5. **Naming**: Slug describes content (`onboarding-options`, `rate-limiter-explainer`, `flag-editor`), not the request (`user-asked-for-spec`).

## HTML Quality Bar

Every artifact must include:

- `<!doctype html>`, `<meta charset=utf-8>`, `<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">`
- `<title>` matching the content
- A single `<style>` block. System font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`). Readable measure (~70ch max for prose). Generous whitespace.
- Dark mode via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` — match the user's OS.
- Anchor links and a TOC if there are 3+ sections.
- Diagrams as inline `<svg>`, never ASCII. Never unicode-as-color hacks.
- Code snippets in `<pre><code>` with monospace and a subtle background. Syntax highlighting only if it adds value; inline `<span>` colors are fine — no external highlighter library.
- Tables for any tabular data. Don't fake tables with `<pre>`.

For comparison/option-grid artifacts: CSS grid, one card per option, each card labeled with the trade-off it makes.

For interactive editors: end with an export button (`Copy as JSON`, `Copy as prompt`, `Copy as markdown`) that builds the export string and writes it to clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText(...)`. Show a brief "copied" confirmation.

For PR/code explainers: render the actual diff with `+`/`-` line gutters, inline margin annotations as `<aside>` elements, severity badges (info/warn/critical) as colored pills.

## Use Cases (with prompt shapes)

These map 1:1 to the article. Each is a _kind_ of artifact this skill produces.

| Use case                        | Defining feature of the HTML                                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-option exploration        | Grid of N cards, each card = one approach, each labeled with its trade-off |
| Implementation plan             | Sections for data flow, mockups, key snippets, risk register; TOC at top   |
| PR creation explainer           | Renders the diff + annotations; attach link to the PR description          |
| PR review                       | Same as above + severity-coded findings                                    |
| Code/feature explainer          | One flow diagram (SVG) + 3–4 annotated snippets + gotchas section          |
| Research/status/incident report | Headline finding at top, supporting sections below, sources cited inline   |
| Design system reference         | Component gallery, each component with code snippet + live render          |
| Component prototype             | Live rendered component + sliders/knobs binding to CSS variables           |
| Throwaway editor                | Form/dragger UI for the specific data + export button                      |

## Token / Latency Trade-Off

HTML costs 2–4× the tokens and time of equivalent markdown. Accept this. The user has opted into the trade-off by enabling this skill. Do not propose "should I do markdown instead to save tokens" — the answer is no.

The only legitimate fallback to markdown is: the user explicitly asked for markdown, or the artifact is < ~50 lines and would be silly as an HTML file (in which case this skill should not have fired at all).

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                             | Fix                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recapping the HTML's contents in chat               | Chat = pointer + warnings only. Delete the recap.       |
| External CDN deps (Tailwind via CDN, Google Fonts)  | Inline everything. System fonts, hand-written CSS.      |
| ASCII diagrams inside `<pre>`                       | Replace with inline `<svg>`.                            |
| Forgetting to open the file                         | Always use the platform opener after writing.           |
| Writing to repo root or `./artifacts/` (no dotfile) | Use `./.Codex/artifacts/`. Gitignore it.               |
| Committing artifacts                                | Don't, unless asked. Gitignore on first use.            |
| Generic slug like `output.html` or `report.html`    | Slug describes content.                                 |
| "Should I make this HTML?" preamble                 | Just do it. The skill fired; the decision is made.      |
| Markdown table dumped into chat instead of the HTML | The chat reply is one line. The table goes in the file. |

## Rationalizations to Reject (captured from real failures)

These are the exact thought-shapes that caused this skill to NOT fire when it should have. If you catch yourself thinking any of them, you are rationalizing — invoke the skill.

| Rationalization                                                                             | Reality                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "User said 'do what you think is best' / 'no format preference', so markdown is fine here"  | The skill's trigger explicitly covers this. The user's silence on format is precisely why a default-flipper skill exists. Use HTML.        |
| "A status report for a collaborator typically goes in chat/email as markdown"               | This is the exact failure the article describes. Markdown reports go unread. Use HTML and the user shares the link.                        |
| "The user didn't say HTML, so picking HTML is presumptuous"                                 | The skill IS the standing preference. Triggering it is honoring the user's setup, not presuming.                                           |
| "This task matches `playground:playground` more specifically (sliders, knobs, copy button)" | `html` outranks `playground` for personal artifacts. Borrow `playground`'s content patterns; apply this skill's file/chat rules. |
| "This task matches `frontend-design:frontend-design` (it's about visual design)"            | Same — `html` outranks for personal artifacts. Borrow the design quality; apply this skill's file/chat rules.                    |
| "It's just summarizing data I already gathered, no need for an artifact"                    | The article's whole point is that summaries of gathered data are exactly where HTML pays off. Use the skill.                               |
| "Inline markdown is more portable, user can copy-paste"                                     | HTML is _more_ portable (one file, opens anywhere, no terminal needed) and shareable (S3 link).                                            |
| "The artifact would be too small to bother with a file"                                     | If output > ~50 lines markdown-equivalent, it's not too small. If it has a diagram or comparison, it's not too small.                      |
| "I'll just produce markdown AND mention the skill exists"                                   | No — the skill exists to _replace_ the markdown, not coexist with it.                                                                      |

## Red Flags — STOP

If you notice yourself doing any of these, you've lost the plot:

- Writing more than 3 lines of chat reply alongside an HTML artifact
- Listing what's in the HTML ("The report includes a summary, a diagram, and…")
- Asking the user "want me to also explain it here?"
- Generating ASCII art when you could generate SVG
- Adding `<link rel=stylesheet href=https://...>` to the file
- Saving a `.md` file when the trigger conditions matched
- Invoking `playground:playground` or `frontend-design:frontend-design` instead of this skill for a personal artifact
- Writing the artifact to `/tmp/<something>.html` or `~/Desktop/` instead of `./.Codex/artifacts/`
- Reasoning "the user said 'no format preference' so I'll pick markdown" — that phrasing is precisely when this skill SHOULD fire
- Producing a long markdown summary in chat while also writing the HTML (double-output)

**All of these mean: rewrite as a self-contained HTML file at `./.Codex/artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html`, invoke THIS skill (not an adjacent one), with a one-line chat reply.**

## Discovery Hint for Future Sessions

Artifacts live in `./.Codex/artifacts/`. If the user references "the spec you made" or "that explainer," check there first, sorted by date.
